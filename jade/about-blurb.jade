br
h4.about-blurb How did you get here?
p
  | I started as a web designer in 
  a.text-link(href='http://www.thedesignpeople.com/', target='_blank') a small design studio in the Philippines
  |  that specializes in US Realtors' websites. I then moved on to another studio that did web and digital marketing design for major Philippine brands. Early 2010, I was hired by 
  a.text-link(href='http://www.aleph-labs.com/', target='_blank') a design studio in Singapore
  |  to do UI/UX work for major financial institutions (read: banks). I eventually took on project management, on top of still being the only designer for any project I was assigned to&mdash; more often that not. A year and a half after that, 
  a.text-link(href='https://twitter.com/Identified', target='_blank') Identified
  |  brought me on as a UX Designer and I moved to San Francisco. We realized soon after I joined that the company needed someone in charge of the brand AND the product's visual direction, so I became Identified’s Art Director. Identified was 
  a.text-link(href='http://www.workday.com/identified.php', target='_blank') acquired
  |  by 
  a.text-link(href='http://www.workday.com/', target='_blank') Workday
  |  in 2014 where I focused on UI/UX design for internal projects and analytical application product concepts.
br
h4.about-blurb Any skills you're willing to brag about?
p 
  | I like to wear a lot hats. Most of my time at Identified involved jumping between product, marketing and identity design work, depending on the need. These needs span across all types of media– I created UI mockups for our flagship enterprise product, created a style guideline for any marketing materials, and even created 
  a.text-link(href='item-video-syman.html', target='_blank') promotional
  |  
  a.text-link(href='item-video-betts.html', target='_blank') videos
  | . I even designed company merch.

p 
  | Tools of the trade are the usual suspects: Adobe Creative Suite stuff: Photoshop, Illustrator, Lightroom, InDesign, After Effects and Premiere. I've been rocking Sketch a lot recently, and use Balsamiq Mockups and Axure for wireframing. I have a good working knowledge of HTML/CSS standards, and have taken up a bit of front-end development work, focusing on Jade, Slim, HAML & SASS to add to my current skillset since joining Workday. Heck, I took a regular html template and turned it into a  
  a.text-link(href='jade/layout.jade', target='_blank') custom
  | 
  a.text-link(href='jade/index.jade', target='_blank') Jade
  | 
  a.text-link(href='jade/_item.jade', target='_blank') template
  |  for my portfolio!
br
h4.about-blurb That's not bragging at all. So what's next for you?
p 
  | I'm looking for a more senior position at a smaller company in a  design lead role that would entail mentoring and working  with talented designers, while still getting my hands dirty doing production work. I’m excited about any opportunity that allows me to continue to focus on what I love doing: designing things that not only look good, but feel good– be it web, mobile, print, or motion.
br
h4.about-blurb One last thing, is it really "Ego"?
p 
  | Yes. And no, I'm not an 
  a.text-link(href='http://english.stackexchange.com/questions/7482/whats-the-difference-between-egotism-and-egoism', target='_blank') egoist/egotist
  |  (or so I like to think). It's also not my stripper name. 
p 
  | You should ask me about my 
  a.text-link(href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jor-El', target='_blank') middle name
  | . That would blow your socks off.
