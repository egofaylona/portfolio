h4 So tell us a bit about yourself, Ego
p I'm a San Francisco-based visual designer with focused skill point allocation in brand and UI/UX design for web and mobile. I do print and motion pretty well, too, if I do say so myself.

p Oh, and PH > SG > SF. Put that in there somewhere.

h4 What have you done with your life so far?
p
  | I started as a web designer in 
  a.text-link(href='http://www.thedesignpeople.com/', target='_blank') a small design studio in the Philippines
  |  that specialized in US Realtors' websites. I then moved on to a company that did web design for major brands in the country. A few months after that, I was hired by 
  a.text-link(href='http://www.aleph-labs.com/', target='_blank') a design studio in Singapore
  |  to do UI/UX work for major financial institutions (read: banks) in Singapore. A year after that, 
  a.text-link(href='https://twitter.com/Identified', target='_blank') Identified
  |  brought me on as a UX Designer. This shifted shortly after to an Art Director role that put me in charge of the brand AND the product's visual direction. Identified was 
  a.text-link(href='http://www.workday.com/identified.php') acquired
  |  by 
  a.text-link(href='http://www.workday.com/', target='_blank') Workday
  |  in 2014.

h4 Any skills you're willing to brag about?
p I like to wear a lot hats. Most of my time at Identified involved jumping between product, marketing and sales design work, depending on the need. These needs span across all types of media. I even designed company swag. 
p Tools-wise, The usual Adobe Creative Suites stuff: Photoshop, Illustrator, Lightroom, InDesign, After Effects and Premiere. I've been rocking Sketch a lot recently, and use Balsamiq Mockups and Axure for wireframing. I have a good working knowledge of HTML/CSS standards, and have taken up a bit of front-end development work, focusing on Jade, Slim, HAML & SASS to add to my current skillset. Heck, I took a regular html template and turned it into a custom Jade template for my portfolio!
br
h4 So what's next for you?
p I'm looking for a lead design role that would entail me leading a team (duh) of a couple of talented designers, while still getting my hands dirty doing production work.
